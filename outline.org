* Paper Outline

Here's a rough sketch of the paper's sections. We can organize the paper here at a high level and then track contents of each of the sections here in separate files.

** Introduction
- Image augmentation - some kinds of data are difficult to acquire
- Problems with documents: denoising, classification, OCR
- Additional use cases: robustness testing for OCR, classification, etc.
- Augraphy and how it helps

** Structure of Augraphy
- Document layers
- Augmentations
- Base
- Utilities

** Competition
- Overview
- Participation
- Results

** Prior Art
There are several data augmentation tools/libraries already for image data augmentation. However, most of these tools are aimed at general use cases, and not document analysis. Hence there is a gap in the augmentation tool landscape that is filled by Augraphy.

*** Augmentation tools for document analysis:
- DocCreator (http://www.mdpi.com/2313-433X/3/4/62/pdf)

*** General purpose augmentation tools for images:
- Albumentations (https://albumentations.ai/); general purpose
- Augmentor (https://github.com/mdbloice/Augmentor); general purpose
- Augly (https://github.com/facebookresearch/AugLy); general purpose
- imgaug (https://imgaug.readthedocs.io/en/latest/); general purpose
- TorchIO (https://torchio.readthedocs.io/transforms/augmentation.html); this library seems to focus on medical image processing
- AutoAugment (https://github.com/DeepVoltaire/AutoAugment); non-essential related work
